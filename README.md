# What I have done in this project
- Simple Todo app
- Use react-router to navigate between pages
- Use axios to fetch API
- Connect to Golang backend on localhost
- Use Redux for states management


# What can be improved
- Better HTML/CSS
- Use axios interceptor to handle requests and responses better (Ex: Authorization header, Error response toast)
- Better filter for todo tasks (Ex: search task by name, by date, filter completed tasks only, ...)
